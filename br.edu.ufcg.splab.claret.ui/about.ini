    Central Artifact for Requirements Engineering and Model-Based Testing\n\
    \n\
    Leveraging Requirements Engineering (RE) and Model-Based Testing (MBT) practices is challenging. On one hand, use case specifications may lack information that is key to automated test case generation. On the other hand, MBT demands can increase costs of RE practices.\n\
    \n\
    We propose CLARET, a notation that allows for creation of natural language use case specifications during RE practices as a central artifact for both RE and MBT. Due to its simplicity and programming like format, we can write CLARET specifications in a less bureaucratic way, and, from them, automatically generate RE and MBT artifacts.\n\
    \n\
    A tool-set supports CLARET specification by checking syntax as well as providing visualization of flows for use case revisions.\n
